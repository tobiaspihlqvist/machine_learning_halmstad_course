    "In this part of the Lab, you will implement the *k nearest neighbours* (kNN) classification method, and apply it to a dataset. Your task is to predict whether microchips from a fabrication plant passes quality assurance (QA). During QA, each microchip goes through various tests to ensure it is functioning correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you are the product manager of the factory and you have the test results for some microchips on two different tests. From these two tests, you would like to determine whether the microchips should be accepted or rejected. To help you make the decision, you have a dataset of test results on past microchips, from which you can build a *k nearest neighbours* classifier.\n",

    "## Loading the data\n",
    "We have a file `microchips-dataset.csv` which contains the dataset for our *nonlinear* classification problem. The first column corresponds to the result of \"microchip test 1\", the second column corresponds to the result of \"microchip test 2\", and the third column is the class-label indicating if the microchip has been accepted or rejected (1 = Accepted, 0 = Rejected).\n",

    "\n",
    "**Note**: You DO NOT need to add an additional column of all ones to the dataset as we are NOT using a linear model of the form $h_{\\theta}(x)={\\theta}^T x$ in this part of the Lab."

    "**Side Note:** From the figure you can see that our dataset cannot be separated into positive (class 1) and negative (class 0) examples by a straight-line through the plot. Therefore, a straightforward application of logistic regression will not perform well on this dataset since logistic regression will only be able to find a linear decision boundary. If one still wants to use logistic regression, then one way to fit the data better is to create more features from each data-point by mapping the features into polynomial terms of $x_1$ and $x_2$ (e.g. $x_1^2$, $x_1 x_2$, etc ...). However, in this part of the Lab, we will use a kNN which is a nonlinear classifier.\n",

Note that this is simply the norm of the vector $u - v$, so you can either code it by yourself in pure Python, or make use of the numpy function `np.lianalg.norm(..)` which returns the norm of a given vector (or you can try both to see if you implemented it correctly).\n",
